Hi my name is Ivana. 
I am is currently an assistant professor of biocatalysis and biomolecular chemistry at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam (appointed July 2020). I obtained my bachelor and master degree in Biochemistry from Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Repblic. I completed her PhD in Organic Chemistry at the Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, the University of Groningen in 2017 (in Prof. Roelfes group), followed by postdoctoral research in Biotechnology at Graz University of Technology (Prof. Kourist group). My efforts culminated in an award from the Dutch Catalysis Society for the best PhD thesis in the area of catalysis from a Dutch institution (years 2016-2018) and a top 5 Dream Chemistry Award in 2020. I was awarded a Veni fellowship (2020), an FWF-funded project (2021) (Prof. Robert Kourist, TU Graz, acting as an international collaborator) and Bertus Kemp Stipendium. Currently I am a coordinator of the recently awarded MSCA Doctoral Network, BiocatCodeExpander, consisting of 14 international academic and industrial partners.
