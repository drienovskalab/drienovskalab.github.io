Hi! my name is Alejandro. I'm from Chile and I'm currently working as a postdoc at Drienovska's Lab at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I did my bacherlor's (BSc biochemistry) and master's (MSc environmental biochemistry) degrees at Universidad de Chile. I then obtained my PhD at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile and at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (Prof. M.W.Fraaije's Lab). I'm currently working on the project: 'Expanding the enzyme universe: a closer look at unnatural amino acids' where we ivestigate a set of unnatural amino acids with high catalytic potential for the generation of sustainable artificial enzymes for new-to-nature biocatalysis. Also I recently joined as project manager for BioCatExpander (EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme)
