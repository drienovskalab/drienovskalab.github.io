Hi my name is Elisa Bonandi and I'm an Italian researcher. I work in Dr. Ivana Drienovska's group at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam and my task is to synthesise and incorporate non-canonical amino acids in enzymes. Even though I'm currently expanding my background in microbiology, I hold a PhD in Chemistry (University of Milan, Italy), with a particular focus on the synthesis of derivatives of bioactive natural products. In my free time I really enjoy travelling and this passion prompted me to move abroad, firstly as a visiting PhD student at the University of Warwick (UK) and then as a postdoc at the Leibniz Universitat of Hannover (Germany) and at the VU Amsterdam.
